# Spotify Nueral Networks

## Project Descpription
After some time of listening to music Spotify will begin to make suggestions of other artists and songs that you might like, I think this can be improved. Spotify has a publicly available API that I will be using for this project. One thing that I have noticed about patterns in music is that people will typically listen to different types of music at different times of the day and different days of the week. Spotify does not account for that when making its suggestions. Using Spotify for Developers web API I m going to pull the databases of users and build a deep learning model using neural networks to better make suggestions for users. 


## Contribution
My goal is to create a web application using Spotify's DEveloper Tools API that will use a series of nueral networks to better make ssong suggestions. The application willl have to run in the background while you are using spotify so that the applicationm can learn your behavior and music trends throughout the day. 

## Educational Goals
This project will very easily check off multiple learning objectives of this class, Inluding but not limited to:  
-Object Oriented Design: I will have to create an array of different objectgs to handle and access the data I will be pulling from the spotify user.  
-Remote Procedure Calls: Any call made using the Spotify API will be a Remote call as the procedures wont be local on my machine.   
-Multi-Threading/PArelle Compuiting: Multi-Threading and Parallel Processing is what makes Nueral Networks so powerful. By definition Deep learning is a multi-  threaded process.    
-Unified Modeling Language: I will create digrams to create a digram to streamline the devolopment and keep me on some sort of track.    
-Graphic User Interface: There will have to be some kind of visual interface that makes this web application usable.  
-Access to Database:I will have to continually access and parse massive amounts of data from Spotify's database.
