##Spotify Nueral Networks

#Project Descpription


#Contribution
My goal is to create a web application using Spotify's DEveloper Tools API that will use a series of nueral networks to better make ssong suggestions. The application willl have to run in the background while you are using spotify so that the applicationm can learn your behavior and music trends throughout the day. 

#Educational Goals
This project will very easily check off multiple learning objectives of this class, Inluding but not limited to:
-Object Oriented Design: I will have to create an array of different objectgs to handle and access the data I will be pulling from the spotify user.
-Remote Procedure Calls: Any call made using the Spotify API will be a Remote call as the procedures wont be local on my machine. 
-Multi-Threading/PArelle Compuiting: Multi-Threading and Parallel Processing is what makes Nueral Networks so powerful. By definition Deep learning is a multi-threaded process.  
-Unified Modeling Language: I will create digrams to create a digram to streamline the devolopment and keep me on some sort of track.  
-Graphic User Interface: There will have to be some kind of visual interface that makes this web application usable.
-Access to Database:I will have to continually access and parse massive amounts of data from Spotify's database.
